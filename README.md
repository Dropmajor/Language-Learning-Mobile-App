# Language-Learning-Mobile-App
## Introduction
This is a react native built to complement language learning. I built this to aid my German learning.<br>
The idea behind this app is to combine a translation app and a flashcards app to act as a convenient package to allow you to translate new phrases and save them as flashcards to allow for easy revision

<b>Note: If you want to run this app properly you need to supply your own Deepl & ChatGPT API keys in [this file](https://github.com/Dropmajor/Language-Learning-Mobile-App/blob/main/Flashcard-App/components/APIDataHandler.js)</b>
